Firefly The Game with Blue Sun &amp; Kalidasa expansions.

Yes, this is a Board Game conversion. 
Why do this?  Well, the game has A LOT of content and most play pieces in the game (Crew, Gear, Ship Upgrades) have unique 'abilities'.
Keeping track of all the quirks and perks in play at one time can be challenging. Going Digital manages all these for you, allowing you to concentrate more on strategy.
The inclusion of one or more 'AI Bots' to play against transforms Single Play into something much more than ever, an experience you cannot get with the original board game.

A Fan made Indie Game, developed 'old school' using Visual Basic 6 and utilises a MS Access 2007 Database to store game resource and runtime data. 
There is extensive use of SQL and ADO Recordsets to feed game functions.
The application uses 2 licenced ActiveX Components. SftTree (SoftelVDM) & XDockFloat (DSXtech). 
Developed and tested on Windows 10. Setup package built using Inno Setup.

This Windows PC Application is provided Open Source, and made available as Freeware. All rights remain with Gale Force Nine and the respective rights holders for the source content and material.
